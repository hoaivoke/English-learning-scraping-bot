# English-learning-scraping-bot
The code for a bot that automatically scans the Cambridge dictionary and then return some multiple choice questions which you can put through quizziz to make a fun quiz to learn english

The bot uses BeautifulSoup to pull words from the Cambridge dictionary base on the words of the subject you want to learn about

Some questions you might have :

- Yes this code is made almost entirely by ChatGPT
- Yes this is for a school project that i need to do to earn extra credits
- No i did not get permission from Cambridge dictionary to use their product and frankly, i don't really feel like it's all that necessary. If this doesn't sit well with you then you can just not use it. I'm just trying to have a good time
- Yes you can do whatever with this code. It's not like i put that much energy into it anyway (-12 hour)

Lastly, if you're lazy like me and don't want to read the code then that's fine too. Just do this if you want to use the code :

1. Change the WORD_COUNT value to the number of questions you want
2. Modify the canidate words so it fits you liking (just think of a topic and ask ChatGPT for word relating to it but have the distance as far as possible if you know what i mean)
3. Go to google colab and run the code
4. You're welcome
